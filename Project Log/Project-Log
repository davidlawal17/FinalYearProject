Project Log- Investr
Evidence of some of my work that I have been working on is shown in the project Log folder, for example pictures of my wireframes and a document of research I did before starting 

Note- I am behind on my schedule which I planned in the interim report 
The work which I have already completed in the previous weeks are:
#Setting up my pycharm enviornment and firebase.
#Making the different  git branches
# I have made two new branches: develop and user/authentication
# I have made a start to the user authentication, I have set up a firebase project and I am working on making a connection between pycharm and  firebase, however I have encountered a couple of issues.
After a bit of research, I concluded that its best for me to create a virtual enviornment, as the problem seems to do with version issues. The virtual environment will allow me to maneouver these version conflicts

Considering that the project started on the 23rd of September 2024
I am now on week 20 of the Project
Week Monday 10th February - Sunday 16th February
# As I behind and my interview is next week, the plan for this week is to make as much progress as I can
More specifcally I am to,
1.Finish the user authentication system, along with the integration of the PostgreSQL database. 
2. Work on the frontend development, in terms of basic components such as the homepage(dashboard). The aim here is not to completely finish the frontend, but have Completed enough to have a competent workable demo for the interview
3. I aim on a core functional feature, which i will decided later on in the week, probably the Property search and filter.
4. Start Creating a presentation for my interview next week

Week Monday 17th February- Sunday 23rd February 
This is a continuation of what I was working on the previous week. I have made significant progress with implementing the backend of the user authentication system. This week i will focus on intergating the PostgreSQL database, after that I focus on implementing some frontend features, so I can see the authentication process in action. Then as stated before, I will begin woring on a core featurw which I have decied will be the property search and filter, and prepare for my interview.

Week Monday 24th February- Sunday 2nd March
I have compeleted the user authentication, integrated PostgreSQL for the backend, and have implemented some frontend design. Now I am focsuing on devloping and implementing my core features: which are the property search and filter feature , the recommendation system and the simulation system. I will start with the property search and filter feature.
- I have thought of new features to add which I didn't mention in my interim report. These features are a "save property" feature, which allows the user to save properties which they like, the other is a "news" or "trending feature", which displays relevant information about the real estate market. Additionally, I want to remove the "begginers guide" feature as in accordance to the feedback I recived from my interim report, I don;t think it's an efficinet use of my time to gain technical marks
The "save property" feature and "news/trending" is a more efficient use of my time which are both more technical

Week Monday 3rd March - Sundy 9th March 
This week I am continuing on developing the property filter and search feature. After experimenting with my code during last week, I decided to change my approach. The API which I initally planned to use was not suitable
for the property search and filter , as the data was not to do with indiviual prperties, but was conclusions on properties in specific postcodes: therefore it's not suitable for property listings. I then tried to web scrape to obtain data for this feature, however I ran into some issues (companies don't want their sites being scraped for free). After brainstorming, I decided to go with a "crowdsourced" approach. Meaning that the users can upload their own properties to sell. However I will initally upload some properties, to get the ball rolling
Whether these properties which i intially upload, will be real or not, is something which I am contemplating.

Update:
I have implemented a working property search and filter feature. Based on my experience implemnting this feature, I have decided that the properties listed on this festure will not be real, however they will be as realistic as possible to give an accurate account of the property market>
I am now working on the save property feature, which allows the users to save their favourite property. I am yet to add a sell feature where users can post properties which they want to sell. I am not sure If I will add this do to time constraints/difficulty.

Week Monday 10th March - Sunday 16th March
This week I am continuing my work on implementing the save property feature, as stated in my last Update. By the end of this week I hope to have this completed, So I can move onto the two most complex features which are the simulation and recommendation feature. 
If I manage to finish the save property feature before the end of the week, I will get started on the news/trending feature.

Week Monday 17th March - Sunday 22nd March
Unfortnualtey I wasn't able to finish the save property feature last week, and will have to continue working on it this week. However, am I very close to completing it so it shoudln't take long. 
One of the difficutlites I encountered with this was implemnting flask JWT (Json Web Token). I needed to set this to authenticate and protect my API endpoints, ensuring users could only access their specific data, so in this case ensuring that 
each users saved property will be unique to them

However I kept encounering errors, it got to a point where my web app wouldn't even render on the page and I was just seeing an error.
The main cause of one of the errors which I encountered was using the wrong identifier. Since i am storing the users in tw sepatae database (Firebase for the authentication) and a PostgreSQl database (provided by Heroku) for the managment of user data and the application data,
I needed to find a common identifier that can correctly link and identifiy each user. Initially I used "user id"  which was generated on my heroku database to be the primary key for the user table, however this didn't corretly identify each user. I lated realised it would be better to use the firebaseuid as an identifier. Although this would make the user id pretty much redundant I figured it would be more conveneient than making firebase uid the primary key, as I would have to make a lot of changes.

This week the plan is to finish what I couldn't last week, and to make as much progress on coding as I can
