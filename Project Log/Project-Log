Project Log- Investr
Evidence of some of my work that I have been working on is shown in the project Log folder, for example pictures of my wireframes and a document of research I did before starting 

Note- I am behind on my schedule which I planned in the interim report 
The work which I have already completed in the previous weeks are:
#Setting up my pycharm enviornment and firebase.
#Making the different  git branches
# I have made two new branches: develop and user/authentication
# I have made a start to the user authentication, I have set up a firebase project and I am working on making a connection between pycharm and  firebase, however I have encountered a couple of issues.
After a bit of research, I concluded that its best for me to create a virtual enviornment, as the problem seems to do with version issues. The virtual environment will allow me to maneouver these version conflicts

Considering that the project started on the 23rd of September 2024
I am now on week 20 of the Project
Week Monday 10th February - Sunday 16th February
# As I behind and my interview is next week, the plan for this week is to make as much progress as I can
More specifcally I am to,
1.Finish the user authentication system, along with the integration of the PostgreSQL database. 
2. Work on the frontend development, in terms of basic components such as the homepage(dashboard). The aim here is not to completely finish the frontend, but have Completed enough to have a competent workable demo for the interview
3. I aim on a core functional feature, which i will decided later on in the week, probably the Property search and filter.
4. Start Creating a presentation for my interview next week

Week Monday 17th February- Sunday 23rd February 
This is a continuation of what I was working on the previous week. I have made significant progress with implementing the backend of the user authentication system. This week i will focus on intergating the PostgreSQL database, after that I focus on implementing some frontend features, so I can see the authentication process in action. Then as stated before, I will begin woring on a core featurw which I have decied will be the property search and filter, and prepare for my interview.

Week Monday 24th February- Sunday 2nd March
I have compeleted the user authentication, integrated PostgreSQL for the backend, and have implemented some frontend design. Now I am focsuing on devloping and implementing my core features: which are the property search and filter feature , the recommendation system and the simulation system. I will start with the property search and filter feature.
- I have thought of new features to add which I didn't mention in my interim report. These features are a "save property" feature, which allows the user to save properties which they like, the other is a "news" or "trending feature", which displays relevant information about the real estate market. Additionally, I want to remove the "begginers guide" feature as in accordance to the feedback I recived from my interim report, I don;t think it's an efficinet use of my time to gain technical marks
The "save property" feature and "news/trending" is a more efficient use of my time which are both more technical
