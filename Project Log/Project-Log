Project Log- Investr
Evidence of some of my work that I have been working on is shown in the project Log folder, for example pictures of my wireframes and a document of research I did before starting 

Note- I am behind on my schedule which I planned in the interim report 
The work which I have already completed in the previous weeks are:
#Setting up flask and the working environment for my project on pycharm, in terms of the structure of the different files, folders.
#Making the different
# I have made two new branches: develop and user/authentication
# I have made a start to the user authentication, I have set up a firebase project and I am working on making a connection between pycharm firebase, however I have encoutred a couple of issues.
After a bit of research, I concluded that its best for me to create a virtual enviornment, as the problem seems to do with version issues. The virtual environment will allow me to maneouver these version conflicts

Considering that the project started on the 23rd of September 2024
I am now on week 20 of the Project
Week Monday 10th February - Sunday 16th February
# As I behind and my interview is next week, the plan for this week is to make as much progress as I can
More specifcally I am to,
1.Finish the user authentication system, along with the integration of the PostgreSQL database. 
2. Work on the frontend development, in terms of basic components such as the homepage(dashboard). The aim here is not to completely finish the frontend, but have Completed enough to have a competent workable demo for the interview
3. I aim on a core functional feature, which i will decided later on in the week, probably the Property search and filter.
4. Start Creating a presentation for my interview next week

Week Monday 17th February- Sunday 23rd February 
This is a continuation of what I was working on the previous week. I have made significant progress with implementing the backend of the user authentication system. This week i will focus on intergating the PostgreSQL database, after that I focus on implementing some frontend features, so I can see the authentication process in action. Then as stated before, I will begin woring on a core featurw which I have decied will be the property search and filter, and prepare for my interview.
